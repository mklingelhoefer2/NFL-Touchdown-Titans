# NFL Touchdown Titans
An NFL game simulated using JavaScript.

## What is this program?
This JavaScript program creates an NFL team of 6 players for yourself and the CPU.
Once the teams are filled, the offensive players go head-to-head with the defensive players and score depending on whether the offensive player is better than the defensive player.
The game consists of 6 drives (3 drives by each team).
If the game is tied after 6 drives, both teams will enter overtime where the winner is randomly decided through an indefinite amount of drives.

## How to run
Download the JavaScript program and run it with whichever method you choose.

## Future updates
- Ability to draft your players
- Delay between messages so that the game happens in real-time and not all at once
- Visual interface
